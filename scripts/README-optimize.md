Image optimization removed

The image optimization script and instructions have been disabled per request. The app now serves the original images from `public/images` using standard `<img>` tags.

If you want to reintroduce image optimization in the future, restore or replace `scripts/optimize-images.js` and this README with appropriate instructions.
